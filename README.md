This group project focuses on the automatic classification of medication data extracted from textual information utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 
Our project is a collaborative effort by our team, which includes Annapurna Padmanabhan, Anju B J, Sourikta Nag, Mansi Malani and myself, 
and without the contributions and dedication of each member, this project would not have been a success. Our core approach integrates 
Word2Vec embeddings with Naive Bayes classification to effectively identify and categorize medication-related information within sentences. 
This integration also aims to significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of data extraction processes in healthcare applications.
